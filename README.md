Work in Progress Jarm Tool. 

Thesis paper can be found in this repository, feel free to DM me @N0tHarbor on Discord if you have questions! 

Remove Return Statment in ./src/Jarm_Threaded.py to see output or read SQLite file. (Currently the fastest JARM tool on the internet, well to my knowlage anyway)

Hyper threaded DB write was very upset and has a pickeling error. Currently Broken...

Paths are all hard coded currently may need to edit those for the tool to work but again still in development.
